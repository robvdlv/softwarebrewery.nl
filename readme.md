## About me
I am an independent hands-on software architect with a love for software that delights its users.

I have been delivering business critical software professionally since 2002. In different roles and projects I have experienced practices and processes that support change. Since change is constant, I believe feedback is critical to success on all levels; understanding ultimately software is about people.

I like to think about ways in which systems may break in order to allow them to recover gracefully. I care about delivering systems that can be reasoned about and are expressed in terms of their targeted domain, helping the business move forward. I value quality of work delivered and thrive in an active community with the same drive to grow and learn new things everyday.

Aside from brewing software I love to read, fish and ride my motorcycle.

## Resumé
**Software Engineer**, Freelance (2024 aug - 2025 jul, [bol.com](https://www.bol.com))<br/>
Enhancing Bol.com's selling offer conversion-focused services.<br/>

With an increasing trend in both traffic and the desire to experiment and innovate, we identified key challenges in
services our team inherited. Aside from making continuous reliability and performance improvements on the existing system, my team worked closely with
the product team. We were able to re-envision its scope to better align with the business goals. This included a focus on
auditability, performance and scalability and cost-control options.

We translated this into a set of key performance indicators (KPIs), architectural drivers and
system design principles to further inform architectural decisions. Seeking fast feedback on the reimagined service
while delivering business value, we identified a set of key features to implement in the next quarter.
We implemented a proof-of-concept demonstrating key concepts to validate our initial approach and set out actionable
milestones and tasks.

**Solution Architecture / DevEx**, Freelance (2022 sep - 2024 apr, [DHL eCommerce NL](http://www.dhlecommerce.nl/))<br/>
As initial member the DevEx team I applied sentiment analysis to help identify areas of improvement for the
developer experience of the software teams. For example, to aid teams in migrating their existing services to run on
Kubernetes, we documented its layout and relation to existing infrastructure as to use it effectively. To help teams
discover and use available infrastructure we piloted Backstage developer portal.

**Software Engineer**, Freelance (2020 jul - 2022 jun, [bol.com](https://www.bol.com))<br/>
Enhancing Bol.com's selling offer calculation and publication platform.<br/>
<br/>
Aside from working on core platform features in tier 1 services, I was involved in the transition of the platform to an
event driven architecture.
<br/>
I initiated a first proof of concept with my team to spark a perspective shift in thinking about offer processing from a
pipelined architecture to an event driven one.<br/>

Helped guide this transition at the team level by hands-on implementing some of the first critical services to adopt
the event driven approach. In order to address testing and maintainability concerns present in existing services, I
proposed adopting ports-and-adapters architectural style for our services which the team embraced.
By applying distributed systems design patterns from the start, our services ran reliably and became a template for
future services to follow.<br/>

**Lead Software Engineer**, Freelance (2018 feb - 2019 sep, [Royal FloraHolland](https://www.royalfloraholland.com))<br/>
Building the Floriday platform<br/>
<br/>
As one of the largest auction companies in the world, the Royal Flora Holland moves huge numbers of flowers and plants daily.
To facilitate both the buyer and seller side of this movement online, we develop Floriday.
* design for distribution of workload and resilience
* align on integration approaches across teams
* integrate with existing legacy systems to enable 'strangler' style software renewal
* capture the domain model in close collaboration with domain experts to minimize mental mapping and facilitate future change
* we build it we run it

**Senior Software Architect** (2016 - 2018, [doubledutch](https://www.doubledutch.me))<br/>
Rewriting the worlds leading Live Engagement Marketing platform<br/>
* untangling and discovering domains captured in a monolithic codebase which won't scale much further, to open up for change and extension and compartmentalise in services
* teasing out read and write concerns to enable scale when spiky mobile traffic hits our APIs
* making services portable through containerisation and deploying them into the cloud
* facilitating experimentation through e.g. canaries and dark deploys

**Software Architect / Manager** (2011 - 2016, [Deloitte Innovation](https://www2.deloitte.com/nl/nl/pages/innovatie/topics/innovatie.html))<br/>
_“Do the processes in your organization operate according to standard and if not where can you find opportunities to optimize them?”_

I performed hands-on technical guidance of the development team in design, implementation and testing of the [process intelligence software solution](https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/pages/operations/solutions/process-efficiency-with-advanced-analytics.html) that helps answer these questions. Besides being a core member of our development efforts, I kept an eye on trends in the software field and matched approaches, technology choices and implementations where I believed we could benefit from it.<br/>
<br/>
To this day, the software is in use by several F500 companies to successfully increase operational and process efficiency.<br/>

**Senior Software Engineer** (2003 - 2011, JTeam) _<sub>acquired by [Trifork](http://trifork.nl) in 2012</sub>_<br/>
At JTeam I worked on a variety of successful bespoke software projects in different industries and during this period grew into role of Senior Software Engineer. Industries included profit, non-profit, government and healthcare.<br/>
<br/>
I delivered bespoke software systems which often times integrated with third party systems. I worked both in-house and on client-site for and with clients.<br/>
<br/>
Because JTeam nurtured its Extreme Programming culture from inception, I have been ingrained with feedback stimulating practices and methods. I believe I still benefit from these experiences every day.
