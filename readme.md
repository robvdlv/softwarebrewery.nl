## About me
I am an independent hands-on software architect with a love for software that delights its users.

I have been delivering business critical software professionally since 2006. In different roles and projects I have experienced practices and processes that support change. Since change is constant, I believe feedback is critical to success on all levels; understanding ultimately software is about people.

I like to think about ways in which systems may break in order to allow them to recover gracefully. I care about delivering systems that can be reasoned about and are expressed in terms of their targeted domain, helping the business move forward. I value quality of work delivered and thrive in an active community with the same drive to grow and learn new things everyday.

Aside from brewing software I love to read, fish and practice tai chi.
